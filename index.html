          <h3>Software Development for Python</h3>
          <p>The main programming language that I use in softwarwe development
             is Python. I am beginning to understand web development
             (as in HTML, CSS, and Javascript), which is what I used to create
             this website. I started learning Python when I was 10.</p>

          <h3>Table Tennis</h3>
          <p>Not only am I a software developer, but I am also an aspiring
            table tennis player, training hard to improve my skills. My dad
            first introduced me to the sport when I was 8, and I started
            playing seriously and training a few months after I
            turned 11.</p>

          <h3>Piano</h3>
          <p>I play the piano as a hobby and as a skill. I was first
            welcomed to the world piano when my parents brought home a second-hand
            classical piano. I became very interested in the piano, as well
            as some other different instruments, such as the guitar, ukelele,
            and drums.</p>

          <h3>Gardening</h3>
          <p>Gardening has become a hobby of mine throughout the years.
            I look after my plants in my spare time. I mostly plant
            vegetables, though I do have quite a lot of strawberries. Over
            time, I have looked after tomatoes, lettuce, spring onions,
            beetroot, carrot, borage, cauliflower, broccoli, strawberries,
            red cabbage, mint, beans, kale, and so much more!</p>
